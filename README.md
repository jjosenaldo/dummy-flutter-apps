Apps developed as assignments for the "PROGRAMACAO PARA DISPOSITIVOS MOVEIS" undergrad course. Do not give the code too much attention; these small projects by no means aim at code quality.

### Projects

- [f_count](f_count/): updates the number of occupied seats in a restaurant and checks their availability.
- [f_imc](f_imc/): your average IMC calculator.
