Apps developed as assignments for the "PROGRAMACAO PARA DISPOSITIVOS MOVEIS" undergrad course. Do not give the code too much attention; these small projects by no means aim at code quality.

### Projects

- [f_count](f_count/): updates the number of occupied seats in a restaurant and checks their availability.
- [f_imc](f_imc/): your average IMC calculator.
- [f_vespa](f_vespa/): shows stock prices from the Bovespa stocks index. It uses the [hgbrasil](https://www.hgbrasil.com)'s API. If you want to run it, you have to set the variable `_kApiKey` in the [lib/api/http.dart](f_vespa/lib/api/http.dart) file to an actual API key.
